## Yo? Yo! Yo.

I 've been programming since a young age. These days, [people](https://www.diabeloop.com) even pay me for doing it.

### Swift

  * [SwiftRay](https://github.com/Ceroce/SwiftRay) is a Raytracer that I should finish one day. It produces nice pictures and some people even liked tinkering with the code.

### Elm

I like functional languages. [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) is nice and easy. When I grow up, I'll do some Haskell. Or Erlang. Or Lisp/Clojure.

  * [ElmHangman](https://github.com/Ceroce/ElmHangman) is my first attempt at writing a serious program in Elm.
  * [MandElmBrot](https://github.com/Ceroce/MandElmBrot) generates an image of the Mandelbrot Set. Because one should write such a generator in any language.

### Objective-C

I'm so old I've been coding in Objective-C since 2001.

  * [CERoundProgressView](https://github.com/Ceroce/CERoundProgressView) is my most starred GitHub repo of all times. 

### My favourite programming books

  * [Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Modeling-Made-Functional-Domain-Driven-dp-1680502549/dp/1680502549)
  * [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052)
  * [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627)
